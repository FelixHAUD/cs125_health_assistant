## Running the frontend

1. If you have not previouslly installed all required dependencies (or need to update them), do so by running `npm install`.

2. After this, run `npm run dev` in the main project directory.

## Running the basic backend

In a separate terminal change your directory to the src/backend/indexing directory and run 'npm run dev' from there to open the api endpoint. run 'npm install' as well when you first do this as well. Then you should start the frontend. Any changes to the backend you will have to restart it to take effect.
